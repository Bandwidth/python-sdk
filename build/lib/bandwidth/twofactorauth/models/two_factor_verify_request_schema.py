            code.
        application_id (string): The application unique ID, obtained from
            Bandwidth.
        scope (string): An optional field to denote what scope or action the
            2fa code is addressing.  If not supplied, defaults to "2FA".
        digits (float): The number of digits for your 2fa code.  The valid
            number ranges from 2 to 8, inclusively.
        expiration_time_in_minutes (float): The time period, in minutes, to
            validate the 2fa code.  By setting this to 3 minutes, it will mean
            any code generated within the last 3 minutes are still valid.  The
            valid range for expiration time is between 0 and 15 minutes,
            exclusively and inclusively, respectively.
        code (string): The generated 2fa code to check if valid
