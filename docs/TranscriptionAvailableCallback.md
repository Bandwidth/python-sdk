## Example

```python
from bandwidth.models.transcription_available_callback import TranscriptionAvailableCallback

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of TranscriptionAvailableCallback from a JSON string
transcription_available_callback_instance = TranscriptionAvailableCallback.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(TranscriptionAvailableCallback.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
transcription_available_callback_dict = transcription_available_callback_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of TranscriptionAvailableCallback from a dict
transcription_available_callback_form_dict = transcription_available_callback.from_dict(transcription_available_callback_dict)
