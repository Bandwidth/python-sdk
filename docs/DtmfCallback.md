from bandwidth.models.dtmf_callback import DtmfCallback

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DtmfCallback from a JSON string
dtmf_callback_instance = DtmfCallback.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(DtmfCallback.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
dtmf_callback_dict = dtmf_callback_instance.to_dict()
