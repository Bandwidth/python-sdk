```python
from bandwidth.models.gather_callback import GatherCallback

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of GatherCallback from a JSON string
gather_callback_instance = GatherCallback.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(GatherCallback.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
gather_callback_dict = gather_callback_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of GatherCallback from a dict
gather_callback_form_dict = gather_callback.from_dict(gather_callback_dict)
