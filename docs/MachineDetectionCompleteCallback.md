## Example

```python
from bandwidth.models.machine_detection_complete_callback import MachineDetectionCompleteCallback

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of MachineDetectionCompleteCallback from a JSON string
machine_detection_complete_callback_instance = MachineDetectionCompleteCallback.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print MachineDetectionCompleteCallback.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
machine_detection_complete_callback_dict = machine_detection_complete_callback_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of MachineDetectionCompleteCallback from a dict
machine_detection_complete_callback_form_dict = machine_detection_complete_callback.from_dict(machine_detection_complete_callback_dict)
